# MCTS Tic-Tac-Toe
A demonstration of MCTS playing Tic-Tac-Toe, implemented using GameMaker Studio.

## Introduction
This project implements a fully random, minimally blocking MCTS AI that plays Tic-Tac-Toe via a simple animated UI. You can adjust the AI's strength by setting its thinking time with a slider. All code is extensively commented and the main MCTS engine can be adapted in new projects to play other games. 

## Requirements
GameMaker Studio 1.4 or above.

## Installation
Simply download or clone the project onto your system, then open it using GameMaker Studio. For GameMaker Studio 2.x, you must use the Import command to convert it to the new project format.
